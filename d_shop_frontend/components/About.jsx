        <h4>Problem it solves üßê</h4>
        <div className="my-2">
          ‚û§ Many fake e-commerce apps take your money, but never deliver the
          products. So, a smart-contract has been created where I created a
          token called 'Mudra'. People will buy products using Mudra token, and
          when they purchase a product, balance is deducted from their balance
          but is not sent to the seller's account. Rather, balance is kept as it
          is in the smart-contract. Once the product is delivered, then only
          sellers receive their share of money. Hence, preventing any fraud.
